     release, go to the :yocto_home:`Yocto Project documentation page <docs>` and

     much older than the Yocto Project version with which you are working). You
     can see all Yocto Project major releases by visiting the
     :yocto_wiki:`Releases<wiki/Releases>` page. If you need a version of this
     manual for a different Yocto Project release, visit the :yocto_home:`Yocto
     Project documentation page<docs>` and select the manual set by using the
     "ACTIVE RELEASES DOCUMENTATION" or "DOCUMENTS ARCHIVE" pull-down menus.
