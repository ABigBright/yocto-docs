            Git has an extensive set of commands that lets you manage changes
            and perform collaboration over the life of a project.
            Conveniently though, you can manage with a small set of basic
            operations and workflows once you understand the basic
            philosophy behind Git.
            You do not have to be an expert in Git to be functional.
            A good place to look for instruction on a minimal set of Git
            commands is
            <a class="ulink" href="http://git-scm.com/documentation" target="_self">here</a>.
        </p>

            If you do not know much about Git, you should educate
            yourself by visiting the links previously mentioned.

            The following list of Git commands briefly describes some basic
            Git operations as a way to get started.
            As with any set of commands, this list (in most cases) simply shows
            the base command and omits the many arguments they support.
            See the Git documentation for complete descriptions and strategies
            on how to use these commands:
            </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git init</code>:</em></span>
                    Initializes an empty Git repository.
                    You cannot use Git commands unless you have a
                    <code class="filename">.git</code> repository.
                    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p><a name="git-commands-clone"></a>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git clone</code>:</em></span>
                    Creates a local clone of a Git repository that is on
                    equal footing with a fellow developer&#8217;s Git repository
                    or an upstream repository.
                    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git add</code>:</em></span>
                    Locally stages updated file contents to the index that
                    Git uses to track changes.
                    You must stage all files that have changed before you
                    can commit them.
                    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git commit</code>:</em></span>
                    Creates a local "commit" that documents the changes you
                    made.
                    Only changes that have been staged can be committed.
                    Commits are used for historical purposes, for determining
                    if a maintainer of a project will allow the change,
                    and for ultimately pushing the change from your local
                    Git repository into the project&#8217;s upstream repository.
                    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git status</code>:</em></span>
                    Reports any modified files that possibly need to be
                    staged and gives you a status of where you stand regarding
                    local commits as compared to the upstream repository.
                    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git checkout</code> <em class="replaceable"><code>branch-name</code></em>:</em></span>
                    Changes your working branch.
                    This command is analogous to "cd".
                    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git checkout &#8211;b</code> <em class="replaceable"><code>working-branch</code></em>:</em></span>
                    Creates and checks out a working branch on your local
                    machine that you can use to isolate your work.
                    It is a good idea to use local branches when adding
                    specific features or changes.
                    Using isolated branches facilitates easy removal of
                    changes if they do not work out.
                    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git branch</code>:</em></span>
                    Displays the existing local branches associated with your
                    local repository.
                    The branch that you have currently checked out is noted
                    with an asterisk character.
                    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git branch -D</code> <em class="replaceable"><code>branch-name</code></em>:</em></span>
                    Deletes an existing local branch.
                    You need to be in a local branch other than the one you
                    are deleting in order to delete
                    <em class="replaceable"><code>branch-name</code></em>.
                    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git pull</code>:</em></span>
                    Retrieves information from an upstream Git repository
                    and places it in your local Git repository.
                    You use this command to make sure you are synchronized with
                    the repository from which you are basing changes
                    (.e.g. the "master" branch).
                    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git push</code>:</em></span>
                    Sends all your committed local changes to the upstream Git
                    repository that your local repository is tracking
                    (e.g. a contribution repository).
                    The maintainer of the project draws from these repositories
                    to merge changes (commits) into the appropriate branch
                    of project's upstream repository.
                    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git merge</code>:</em></span>
                    Combines or adds changes from one
                    local branch of your repository with another branch.
                    When you create a local Git repository, the default branch
                    is named "master".
                    A typical workflow is to create a temporary branch that is
                    based off "master" that you would use for isolated work.
                    You would make your changes in that isolated branch,
                    stage and commit them locally, switch to the "master"
                    branch, and then use the <code class="filename">git merge</code>
                    command to apply the changes from your isolated branch
                    into the currently checked out branch (e.g. "master").
                    After the merge is complete and if you are done with
                    working in that isolated branch, you can safely delete
                    the isolated branch.
                    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git cherry-pick</code>:</em></span>
                    Choose and apply specific commits from one branch
                    into another branch.
                    There are times when you might not be able to merge
                    all the changes in one branch with
                    another but need to pick out certain ones.
                    </p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">gitk</code>:</em></span>
                    Provides a GUI view of the branches and changes in your
                    local Git repository.
                    This command is a good way to graphically see where things
                    have diverged in your local repository.
                    </p>
<div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
                        You need to install the <code class="filename">gitk</code>
                        package on your development system to use this
                        command.
                    </div>
<p>
                    </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git log</code>:</em></span>
                    Reports a history of your commits to the repository.
                    This report lists all commits regardless of whether you
                    have pushed them upstream or not.
                    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="filename">git diff</code>:</em></span>
                    Displays line-by-line differences between a local
                    working file and the same file as understood by Git.
                    This command is useful to see what you have changed
                    in any given file.
