        Because open source projects are open to the public, they have
        different licensing structures in place.
        License evolution for both Open Source and Free Software has an
        interesting history.
        If you are interested in this history, you can find basic information
        here:

        In general, the Yocto Project is broadly licensed under the
        Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) License.
        MIT licensing permits the reuse of software within proprietary
        software as long as the license is distributed with that software.
        MIT is also compatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL).
        Patches to the Yocto Project follow the upstream licensing scheme.
        You can find information on the MIT license
        <a class="ulink" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php" target="_self">here</a>.
        You can find information on the GNU GPL
        <a class="ulink" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0" target="_self">here</a>.

        When you build an image using the Yocto Project, the build process
        uses a known list of licenses to ensure compliance.
        You can find this list in the
        <a class="link" href="../ref-manual/source-directory.html" target="_self">Source Directory</a>
        at <code class="filename">meta/files/common-licenses</code>.
        Once the build completes, the list of all licenses found and used
        during that build are kept in the
        <a class="link" href="../ref-manual/build-directory.html" target="_self">Build Directory</a>
        at <code class="filename">tmp/deploy/licenses</code>.
    </p>
<p>
        If a module requires a license that is not in the base list, the
        build process generates a warning during the build.
        These tools make it easier for a developer to be certain of the
        licenses with which their shipped products must comply.
        However, even with these tools it is still up to the developer to
        resolve potential licensing issues.
    </p>
<p>
        The base list of licenses used by the build process is a combination
        of the Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) list and the Open
        Source Initiative (OSI) projects.
        <a class="ulink" href="http://spdx.org" target="_self">SPDX Group</a> is a working group of
        the Linux Foundation that maintains a specification for a standard
        format for communicating the components, licenses, and copyrights
        associated with a software package.
        <a class="ulink" href="http://opensource.org" target="_self">OSI</a> is a corporation
        dedicated to the Open Source Definition and the effort for reviewing
        and approving licenses that conform to the Open Source Definition
        (OSD).
    </p>
<p>
        You can find a list of the combined SPDX and OSI licenses that the
        Yocto Project uses in the
        <code class="filename">meta/files/common-licenses</code> directory in your
        <a class="link" href="../ref-manual/source-directory.html" target="_self">Source Directory</a>.

        For information that can help you maintain compliance with various
        open source licensing during the lifecycle of a product created using
        the Yocto Project, see the
        "<a class="link" href="../dev-manual/maintaining-open-source-license-compliance-during-your-products-lifecycle.html" target="_self">Maintaining Open Source License Compliance During Your Product's Lifecycle</a>"
