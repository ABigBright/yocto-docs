            In order for the OpenEmbedded build system to create an image or
            any target, it must be able to access source files.
            The
            <a class="link" href="development-concepts.html#general-yocto-environment-figure">general Yocto Project Development Environment figure</a>
            represents source files using the "Upstream Project Releases",
            "Local Projects", and "SCMs (optional)" boxes.
            The figure represents mirrors, which also play a role in locating
            source files, with the "Source Mirror(s)" box.
        </p>
<p>
            The method by which source files are ultimately organized is
            a function of the project.
            For example, for released software, projects tend to use tarballs
            or other archived files that can capture the state of a release
            guaranteeing that it is statically represented.
            On the other hand, for a project that is more dynamic or
            experimental in nature, a project might keep source files in a
            repository controlled by a Source Control Manager (SCM) such as
            Git.
            Pulling source from a repository allows you to control
            the point in the repository (the revision) from which you want to
            build software.
            Finally, a combination of the two might exist, which would give the
            consumer a choice when deciding where to get source files.

            BitBake uses the
            <a class="link" href="../ref-manual/var-SRC_URI.html" target="_self"><code class="filename">SRC_URI</code></a>
            variable to point to source files regardless of their location.
            Each recipe must have a <code class="filename">SRC_URI</code> variable
            that points to the source.
        </p>
<p>
            Another area that plays a significant role in where source files
            come from is pointed to by the
            <a class="link" href="../ref-manual/var-DL_DIR.html" target="_self"><code class="filename">DL_DIR</code></a>
            variable.
            This area is a cache that can hold previously downloaded source.
            You can also instruct the OpenEmbedded build system to create
            tarballs from Git repositories, which is not the default behavior,
            and store them in the <code class="filename">DL_DIR</code> by using the
            <a class="link" href="../ref-manual/var-BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS.html" target="_self"><code class="filename">BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS</code></a>
            variable.
        </p>
<p>
            Judicious use of a <code class="filename">DL_DIR</code> directory can
            save the build system a trip across the Internet when looking
            for files.
            A good method for using a download directory is to have
            <code class="filename">DL_DIR</code> point to an area outside of your
            Build Directory.
            Doing so allows you to safely delete the Build Directory
            if needed without fear of removing any downloaded source file.

            The remainder of this section provides a deeper look into the
            source files and the mirrors.
            Here is a more detailed look at the source file area of the
            base figure:
