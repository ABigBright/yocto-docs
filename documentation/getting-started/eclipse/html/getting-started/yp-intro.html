        The Yocto Project is an open-source collaboration project whose
        focus is for developers of embedded Linux systems.
        Among other things, the Yocto Project uses an
        <a class="link" href="../ref-manual/build-system-term.html" target="_self">OpenEmbedded build system</a>.
        The build system, which is based on the OpenEmbedded (OE) project and
        uses the
        <a class="link" href="../ref-manual/bitbake-term.html" target="_self">BitBake</a> tool,
        constructs complete Linux images for architectures based on ARM, MIPS,
        PowerPC, x86 and x86-64.
        </p>
<div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
            Historically, the OpenEmbedded build system, which is the
            combination of BitBake and OE components, formed a reference
            build host that was known as
            "<a class="link" href="../ref-manual/poky.html" target="_self">Poky</a>"
            (<span class="emphasis"><em>Pah</em></span>-kee).
            The term "Poky", as used throughout the Yocto Project Documentation
            set, can have different meanings.
        </div>
<p>
        The Yocto Project provides various ancillary tools for the embedded
        developer and also features the Sato reference User Interface, which
        is optimized for stylus-driven, low-resolution screens.

<p>
        Here are some highlights for the Yocto Project:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>
            Provides a recent Linux kernel along with a set of system
            commands and libraries suitable for the embedded
            environment.
            </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
            Makes available system components such as X11, GTK+, Qt,
            Clutter, and SDL (among others) so you can create a rich user
            experience on devices that have display hardware.
            For devices that do not have a display or where you wish to
            use alternative UI frameworks, these components need not be
            installed.
            </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
            Creates a focused and stable core compatible with the
            OpenEmbedded project with which you can easily and reliably
            build and develop.
            </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
            Fully supports a wide range of hardware and device emulation
            through the Quick EMUlator (QEMU).
            </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
            Provides a layer mechanism that allows you to easily extend
            the system, make customizations, and keep them organized.
            </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
        You can use the Yocto Project to generate images for many kinds
        of devices.
        As mentioned earlier, the Yocto Project supports creation of
        reference images that you can boot within and emulate using QEMU.
        The standard example machines target QEMU full-system
        emulation for 32-bit and 64-bit variants of x86, ARM, MIPS, and
        PowerPC architectures.
        Beyond emulation, you can use the layer mechanism to extend
        support to just about any platform that Linux can run on and that
        a toolchain can target.
    </p>
<p>
        Another Yocto Project feature is the Sato reference User
        Interface.
        This optional UI that is based on GTK+ is intended for devices with
        restricted screen sizes and is included as part of the
        OpenEmbedded Core layer so that developers can test parts of the
        software stack.
    </p>
<p>
        While the Yocto Project does not provide a strict testing framework,
        it does provide or generate for you artifacts that let you perform
        target-level and emulated testing and debugging.
        Additionally, if you are an
        <span class="trademark">Eclipse</span>&#8482; IDE user, you can
        install an Eclipse Yocto Plug-in to allow you to develop within that
        familiar environment.
    </p>
<p>
        By default, using the Yocto Project to build an image creates a Poky
        distribution.
        However, you can create your own distribution by providing key
        <a class="link" href="../ref-manual/metadata.html" target="_self">Metadata</a>.
        A good example is Angstrom, which has had a distribution
        based on the Yocto Project since its inception.
        Other examples include commercial distributions like
        <a class="ulink" href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/organization/wind-river-systems" target="_self">Wind River Linux</a>,
        <a class="ulink" href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/organization/mentor-graphics" target="_self">Mentor Embedded Linux</a>,
        <a class="ulink" href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/organization/enea-ab" target="_self">ENEA Linux</a>
        and <a class="ulink" href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/ecosystem/member-organizations" target="_self">others</a>.
        See the "<a class="link" href="../dev-manual/creating-your-own-distribution.html" target="_self">Creating Your Own Distribution</a>"
        section in the Yocto Project Development Tasks Manual for more
        information.
