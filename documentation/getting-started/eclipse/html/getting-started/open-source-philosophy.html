<p>
        Open source philosophy is characterized by software development
        directed by peer production and collaboration through an active
        community of developers.
        Contrast this to the more standard centralized development models
        used by commercial software companies where a finite set of developers
        produces a product for sale using a defined set of procedures that
        ultimately result in an end product whose architecture and source
        material are closed to the public.
    </p>
<p>
        Open source projects conceptually have differing concurrent agendas,
        approaches, and production.
        These facets of the development process can come from anyone in the
        public (community) that has a stake in the software project.
        The open source environment contains new copyright, licensing, domain,
        and consumer issues that differ from the more traditional development
        environment.
        In an open source environment, the end product, source material,
        and documentation are all available to the public at no cost.

        A benchmark example of an open source project is the Linux kernel,
        which was initially conceived and created by Finnish computer science
        student Linus Torvalds in 1991.
        Conversely, a good example of a non-open source project is the
        <span class="trademark">Windows</span>® family of operating
        systems developed by
        <span class="trademark">Microsoft</span>® Corporation.

        Wikipedia has a good historical description of the Open Source
        Philosophy
